"# landing-page" 
This is a landing page assignment done in relation to the Odin Project landing assignment.
This assignment served as a springboard for my learning journey as I progress through The Odin Project's web development curriculum.

Here's a breakdown of what I learn  in this assignment:

Learning Objectives:

Structure a Web Page: I gained hands-on experience building the basic structure of a landing page using HTML. This includes creating sections for headers, navigation, content areas, forms (if applicable), and footers.
Style the Visuals: By implementing CSS, i learn how to control the visual appearance of my landing page. This involves applying styles to elements like text, buttons, images, and backgrounds. I explored concepts like layout, color schemes, typography, and potentially responsive design (making the page adapt to different screen sizes).

Benefits of the Assignment:

Practical Application: This assignment allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge I gained from The Odin Project's lessons to a real-world scenario. I was able to  translate HTML and CSS concepts into a tangible web page.
Solid Foundation: By building a landing page, i established a strong understanding of the fundamentals of web development, which will be crucial for building more complex web applications in the future.
Portfolio Piece: The completed landing page can serve as a valuable addition to my developer portfolio, showcasing my basic web development skills to potential employers or collaborators.
